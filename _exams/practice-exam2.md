Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.

a) if $$(s_n)$$ and $$(t_n)$$ are bounded sequences, then $$\limsup(s_n+t_n) = (\limsup s_n) + (\limsup t_n)$$

b) every sequence has a monotone increasing subsequence

c) there exists a sequence $$(s_n)$$ with the property that every irrational number appears in the sequence at least once

d) every bounded sequence has a monotone convergent subsequence

e) if $$\sum a_n$$ is a convergent series with $$a_n \geq 0$$ for all $$n$$, then $$\sum a_n$$ is absolutely convergent

## Problem 2

a) Write the definition of a function $$f(x)$$ being continuous at a point $$a\in\mathbb{R}$$

b) Carefully state the Ratio Test

c) Write the definition of $$(t_n)$$ being a subsequence of $$(s_n)$$

## Problem 3

Without using any theorems about series, do the following.

* (a) State the Cauchy Criterion for series

* (b) Prove that if $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$$ is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.

* (c) Prove that if if $$\lvert b_n\rvert\leq a_n$$ for all $$n$$ and $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$$ converges, then $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$$ is absolutely convergent.


## Problem 4

Let $$(a_n)$$ be a bounded sequence of real numbers.  Prove that

$$\limsup e^{a_n} = e^{\limsup a_n}.$$

## Problem 5

For each of the following series, determine if it diverges, converges, or converges absolutely.
Carefully justify your answer.

* $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos((2n+1)\pi)}{n}$$

* $$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{(\ln(n))^n}$$

* $$\sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{n^2-\sqrt{n}}{4-n^2}$$

* $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{3^n}{2^{n+2}}$$

* $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{e^n}$$


## Problem 6

Let $$\mathbb{I}$$ be the set of all irrational numbers in the interval $$[0,1]$$.
Consider the function

$$f: I\rightarrow [0,1]$$

defined via decimal expansions by

$$f(0.d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5d_6\dots) = 0.d_1d_3d_5d_7\dots$$

* (a) Prove that this function is well defined.
* (b) Prove that $$f(x)$$ is surjective.
* (c) If we replace $$I$$ with the interval $$[0,1]$$ above, is it still well-defined? Carefully explain.

## Problem 7

Consider the function

$$f(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}\sin(1/x), & x\neq 0\\0 & x=0\end{array}\right.$$

* Prove that $$f(x)$$ is continuous at every point $$a\in\mathbb R$$ with $$a\neq 0$$

* Prove thaat $$f(x)$$ is not continuous at $$x=0$$.
