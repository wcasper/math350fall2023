Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.
Assume both $$(s_n)$$ and $$(t_n)$$ are sequences of real numbers.

a) If $$s_n <  t_n$$ for all $$n$$ then $$\lim s_n < \lim t_n$$

b) The Well-Ordering Principle is equivalent to the Axiom of Induction

c) Any set of real numbers which is bounded above has a maximum

d) Every bounded sequence of real numbers is a Cauchy sequence

e) If $$\lim s_n=0$$, then $$\lim s_nt_n = 0$$

## Problem 2

a) State the Completeness Axiom

b) State the definition of a sequence $$(s_n)$$ converging to $$s$$

c) Carefully state the Squeeze Theorem.

## Problem 3

a) Give the definition of a bounded set

b) Is the set

$$\left\lbrace\frac{1}{x^2-3}: x\in\mathbb Q\right\rbrace$$

bounded?  Carefully justify your answer.

## Problem 4

Consider the sequence $$(s_n)$$ defined by

$$s_n = \frac{2n^2+3}{n^2+2n}.$$

a) Determine the limit of the sequence.

b) Carefully prove that the limit you found in (a) is correct by using the $$\epsilon,N$$-definition of a limit directly.

## Problem 5

For any subset $$A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$$, define $$-A = \{-x: x\in A\}.$$

a) Suppose that $$A$$ is bounded.  Define the supremum of $$A$$.

b) Prove that $$\sup(-A) = -\inf(A)$$ and $$\inf(-A)=-\sup(A)$$.

## Problem 6

Define a sequence $$(s_n)$$ recursively by letting $$s_1 = 3$$ and more generally

$$s_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}s_n +\frac{3}{2s_n}.$$

a) Prove that the sequence is monotone.

b) Prove that the sequence converges.

c) Determine the limit of the sequence.

## Problem 7

Suppose that $$(s_n)$$ is a bounded sequence of real numbers (not necessarily convergent) and that $$t_k = s_{n_k}$$ is a convergent subsequence.

a) Define $$\limsup s_n$$ and explain why it is well-defined

b) Prove that

$$\lim t_k\leq \limsup s_n.$$
