Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)
For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.

* (a) If $$R>0$$ then the radius of convergence of $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{R^k}$$ is $$R$$

* (b) There exists a function $$f(x)$$ which is discontinuous at every rational number and continuous at every irrational number

* (c) If $$f(x)$$ is continuous on an interval, then $$f(x)$$ must be uniformly continuous on that interval

* (d) The function $$f(x) = 1/x$$ is continuous everywhere in its domain

* (e) If $$\lim_{x\rightarrow a+} f(x)$$ and $$\lim_{x\rightarrow a-}f(x)$$ exist, then $$\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)$$ exists

## Problem 2

Give an example of each of the following, or explain why it doesn't exist.

* (a) A function which is uniformly continuous on $$\mathbb{R}$$

* (b) A function which is continuous on $$(0,1)$$ but not uniformly continuous on $$(0,1)$$

* (c) A power series whose radius of convergence is $$R=0$$

* (d) A function which is differentiable at $$x=0$$ but not continuous at $$x=0$$

* (e) A function whose domain is $$\mathbb{R}$$, which is discontinuous at every point in $$\mathbb{R}$$ 

## Problem 3


* (a) State the definition of the radius of convergence of a power series $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$$.

* (b) Suppose that $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \lvert a_n\rvert < \infty$$. Prove that the radius of convergence of $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$$ is at least $$R=1$$.

* (c) Under the assumption of (b), prove that the sequence of polynomials $$f_N(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N a_nx^n$$ converges uniformly on $$[-1,1]$$.


## Problem 4

* (a) Write down the definition of a function $$f(x)$$ being continuous at a point $$a\in\text{Dom}(f)$$.
* (b) Suppose that $$f(x)$$ is continuous at every point in $$(-1,1)$$ and that for every $$x\in (-1,1)$$ we have $$f(x^2) = f(x)$$.  Prove that $$f(x)$$ is a constant function on $$(-1,1)$$.

## Problem 5

Consider the function

$$f(x) = \left\begin{array}{cc} -1 & x < 0\\x-1 & x > 0\\ 0 & x=0\end{array}\right.$$

* (a) Write down the $$\epsilon,\delta$$ definition of the limit as $$x$$ approaches $$a$$ along $$S$$ of $$f(x)$$
* (b) If $$S=(-1,1)\backslash\{0\}$$, carefully show that the limit as $$x$$ approaches $$a$$ along $$S$$ of $$f(x)$$ exists and explain what it is
* (c) If $$S=(-1,1)$$, carefully explain why the limit as $$x$$ approaches $$a$$ along $$S$$ does not exist
* (d) Is $$f(x)$$ continuous at $$x=0$$?  Explain.

## Problem 6

Consider the sequence of functions

$$f_n(x) = \frac{nx}{1 + n^2x}.$$

* (a) Write down the definition of a sequence of functions $$(f_n(x))$$ converging uniformly to $$f(x)$$ on $$S$$.
* (b) Show that the sequence of functions $$f_n(x)$$ converges uniformly to the constant function $$f(x) = 0$$ on $$S=[0,1]$$


## Problem 7

Suppose that $$(f_n(x))$$ is a sequence of continuous functions on $$[0,1]$$ with the property that

$$\lvert f_{n+1}(x)- f_n(x)\rvert < \frac{1}{2}\lvert f_{n}(x)- f_{n-1}(x)\rvert$$

for all integers $$n>1$$ and all $$x\in [0,1]$$.

 * (a) Write down the definition of a sequence of functions being uniformly Cauchy
 * (b) Prove that the functions $$f_n(x)$$ converge to a continuous function $$f(x)$$ on $$[0,1]$$.
