title: What is real analysis
---

Your first course in real analysis studies all the things you learned back in calculus, but now with *proofs*.  This means we will explore
* what the real numbers are
* sequences and series of real numbers
* continuous functions
* sequences and series of functions
* differentiation
* integration

However, we will exploring each of these topics from a much more mature perspective than you previous calculus experience.
Moreover, we will be constantly holding ourselves accountable to explain why all the familiar results and theorems are true.
